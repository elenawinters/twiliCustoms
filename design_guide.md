# Designn Guide

Reference the .txt for what needs to be implemented.

# Engine Audio System

Ideally, the engine audio should change depending on the engine installed.
I'd like to be able to do it with the default GTA audio sounds.

Some engine sounds have variants. A lot of the Muscle car sounds are the same with slight difference between them.

For those specifically, I want the engine power to change the sound used for that engine.

# Simulation

Scope has expanded in an effort to get this project off the groumd. NOS Simulation, Brake Disc Glazing Simulation, and other things are planned
